In July of 2023, I joined the [Short Period Planets Group](http://www.astrojack.com/research/superpig/) (SuPerPiG)! Our group is an international collaboration of scientists working together to understand the phenomenon of tiday decay. Tidal decay is best described by the strong gravitational force of an exoplanet's host star overcoming the gravitational force of the exoplanet causing it to slowly spiral into the host star. My efforts toward this goal have been focused on creatign and executing ground based observing campaigns for the telescopes on the Boise State Campus.
