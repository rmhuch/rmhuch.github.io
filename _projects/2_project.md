In 2023, our program was granted funding from NASAâ€™s Science Activation Program to purchase telescopes to be distributed throughout classrooms in Idaho. This program is called Telescopes for Teachers and I am the Program Lead. As of September 2024, we have distributed 50 Unistellar eQuinox 2 telescopes and reached 57 teachers through our workshops. Learn more about our program at [boi.st/telescopes](boi.st/telescopes).
